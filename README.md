Replacement for the original TXT-C-Programming-Kit-4-1-6

## Overview

### Which tools I need?
This is a MS-Visual Studio project. <br/>
The `solution` and `project` are tested with 
[MS-Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) 
which is free to download and use.<br/>

The original ```SolutionOnlineSamples``` is using the **C14++ dialect** and can also be used with the Eclipse 2020-06 workbench.<br/> 
The new split-up version (into a solution for the library and a solution for the applications) is using the **C17++ dialect**.<br/>
After downloading an solution, it is directly usable with MS Visual Studio 2019.<br/>

### Overview of available MS-Visual Studio 2019 solutions.
The original ```OnlineSamples``` structure contains a mixer of the low level library stuff and end-user applications. This structure has been split up now. This will make the use in for example an educational setting must easier. The end-user needs only ```SolutionTxtApps``` and can add his projects to it.<br/>
The intention is to extended the library  with higher level functions as there were available in the ROBO-interface and TC-controller kits. 

1. ```SolutionTxtApps```
  Applications which are using the ```FtTxtLib``` or ```FtTxtLibDll``` library, including these libs, updates of the original example applications and some test examples.<br/> 
  - The library supports the communication thread now.
  - It also support a set of higher level API functions as they were also present in the TX-C and Robo-interface programming kits. Like (part of the class ```ftIF2013TransferAreaComHandlerEx2```):
    - ```ftxStartTransferArea```, ```ftxStopTransferArea```, ```ftxIsTransferActiv```, ```GetTransferAreasArrayAddr```
    - ```StartMotorExCmd```,  ```IsMotorExReady```
    - ```SetOutMotorValues```, ```GetOutMotorValues```, ```SetOutMotorInverse```
    - ```SetOutPwmValues```, ```GetOutPwmValues```
    - ```SetFtUniConfig```, ```SetFtMotorConfig```, ```SetFtCntConfig```
    - ```GetInIOValue```
    - ```SetSound, IsSoundReady```
    - ```GetMicLin```, ```GetMicLog```
  - [See also the API user manual](./SolutionTxtLib/API-user-manual/0-Start-remote-TXT-API(FtTxtLib-FtTxtLibDll).md)   
1. ```SolutionTxtLib```
  The project to create the static library ```FtTxtLib```  and a dynamic link library (DLL) ```FtTxtLibDll```. <br/>
>  Will be come available later. 

1. ```SolutionOnlineSamples```
    The original ```OnlineSamples```.
    

## History
### 2020-07-16/30 [(c) CvL, TesCaweb.nl]
**TXT-C-Programming-Kit-4-6-6_beta-04**
Re-development of the solution structure.
Re-introduction of a set of higher level API functions. 
  
### 2020-06-28 [(c) CvL, TesCaweb.nl]
The `TA communication` thread has been moved from the application to the Txt Lib.
See also example `TestProg2`.
``` C
  /// <summary>
  /// 3.1 start the communication thread and configere the Motor/Outputs, Inputs and Counters.
  /// </summary>
  /// <remarks> The configurations need to be set before!  </remarks>
  /// <returns>success or error</returns>
  FtErrors ftxStartTransferArea();

  /// <summary>
  /// 3.2 stop the communication thread
  /// </summary>
  /// <returns>success or error </returns>
  FtErrors ftxStopTransferArea();

   /// <summary>
   /// 3.3 Is the communication thread still running?
   /// </summary>
   /// <returns>Is runningr</returns>
  bool   ftxIsTransferActiv();
```
### 2020-06-27 [CvL]
Published **beta version** for RoboPro 4.6.6/4.7.0 pre-release: 
**TXT-C-Programming-Kit-4-6-6_beta-03**

### 2020-06-24 [CvL]
Published  **draft version** for RoboPro 4.6.6: 
**TXT-C-Programming-Kit-4-6-6_beta-02**

Tested with firmware 4.6.6 and on MS-Windows 10 (64 bits)

> Development environment: MS-Visual Studio community 2019,<br/>
  C++ Dialect: C14++

> Added: TestProj02 - example about the use of the enhanced motor control (black box)<br/>
  with the communication between PC and TXT (TA) as thread.
  
> Choice between Compress mode and Simple as setting.<br/>
  
> Test console output conditional with TEST as C++ pre-processor definition. 

> Renamed FtShmem.h into FtShmemTxt.h, add some TXT related comment.<br/>
  Limited the TA size to master + 1 slave, this because the TXT can only work with 1 slave.
  
> I2C communication is not implemented yet because the protocol for send and responds the I2C communication is not available.

### 2019-10-13 [CvL]

> The problem  with the Compressed mode has been resolved.

### 2018-09-18 [CvL]

> The Windows 10 problem around the WinSocket time out settings has been resolved.  

> Note: Don't forget to fill in the right ip-address

> Some additional text output for debugging has also been added.

### 2016 
Original published as `TXT-C-Programming-Kit-4.1.6`.
